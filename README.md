# Noteful

## Summary

Created in coordination with my Thinkful curriculum, this full-stack app allows users to create and organize notes.

The Noteful API utilizes GET, POST and DELETE endpoints along with the corresponding postgreSQL databases. The app's client-side was also written by me (as guided by the Thinkful curriculum) [here](https://github.com/SabrinaSides/noteful-client).
